Description:-
Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Tottenham are known as the BIG SIX clubs of the Premier League. This Visualization addresses on the win/lose ratio and on which year they have won the Title and how much money they have spent in the Transfer Market throughout the 15 years that is from 2005-06 to 2019-20 Seasons.This Visualization also addresses on how many matches those teams have won or lose and how many goals they have scored or conceded and also tells the goal difference from the last 15 years of Premier League.
The plot indicates on how the winning ratio of these teams changes. At one point you would see  Liverpool have the highest win ratio of 30.0 and they lost only 1 match throughout the year still they didn't won the Title. I have scatter the points on the seasons that the team have won the title but in the 2015-16 none of the big six have won the title because that year was the miraculous year for Leicester City. It also show how much money they have spent in the transfer window. As you can see how Manchester City have peak the 2017-18 season with spending more than 250M Â£ highest from any other team. It also indicates on out of 570 matches in 15 years how many they have won and lose and rest are draws which I didn't include because it will become crowded and Manchester United have won more matches than any team and also leads on goals. If you observe closely there are no scatter point for Arsenal and Tottenham because they never won the title in those years.
